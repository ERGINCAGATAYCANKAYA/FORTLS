## Automatic Processing of TLS Point Cloud Data for Forestry Purposes
Process automation of Terrestrial Laser Scanner (TLS) point cloud data derived from single
scans. 'FORTLS' enables (i) detection of trees and estimation of diameter
at breast height (dbh), (ii) estimation of some stand variables (e.g. density,
basal area, mean and dominant height), (iii) computation of metrics related to important forest
attributes estimated in Forest Inventories (FIs) at stand level and (iv) optimization of plot design
for combining TLS data and field measured data. Documentation about 'FORTLS' is described
in Molina-Valero et al. (2020, <https://doi.org/10.3390/IECF2020-08066>).
